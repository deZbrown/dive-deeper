## Project description

Dive Deeper is a web application that acts as a task holder with integrated pomodoro timer for each task.
Idea is to have a single point overview of tasks and time reserved for handling them.

- Each task has time dedicated to it.
- Time tied to specific task is not an estimate for delivery, but timeslot dedicated for work on that task.
- Each task belongs to project or aspect of business or life in general.
- Tasks are tied to a day in calendar but not fixed to specific time in day.
